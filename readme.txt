This demo is about a marketing game to attract customers (users) to provide their contact details via a registration form.


---------------------
Functionality
---------------------
1. Ajax form

- This form stores data in a database.
- Mail functionality
- It takes a unique email ID. If the email ID is already in the database, it will not send mail and will display a warning.


2. Spin the wheel

- I grabbed the source code for this spin wheel from (https://codingartistweb.com/2022/08/spin-wheel-app-with-javascript/).
- You can customise this code as per your requirements.


3. LocalStorage

- It stores Email ID and Spin Wheel Count (i.e., a registered user will be able to spin the wheel a maximum of 2 times).
- After successfully sending an email and storing the data in the database, LocalStorage stores the Email ID and Spin Count.
- You cannot spin again once you have reached the maximum spin count of two.
